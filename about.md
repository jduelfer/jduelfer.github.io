I am a Software Developer living in Barcelona and working in [Puck Solutions](http://www.puck.eu), a great, young company that has a great company culture and workmates. Our team creates an application on top of Salesforce's [Force.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce.com#Force.com) platform that allows private aviation companies to manage everything from ground operations, to sales and crew management. For front-end development, we use [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com), while for back-end we use [Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm), Salesforce's java-like programming language.

#### University

I graduated in 2015 from the University of North Carolina with two degrees in Linguistics and Romance Languages. Linguistics and Romance Languages to a Software Developer? I'm from a small town in the mountains of North Carolina. In high school, I did alot of mathematics and maybe burned myself out for a couple years. When I got the University, I had all of my mathematics requirements already completed and decided that I wanted to learn languages a see the world. For the first two years, that's what I did. 

However, during the summer before my third year, I felt the need for analytical problem solving again. While I was spending the summer in Brazil learning Portuguese and teaching in an elementary school, I spent all of my free-time taking MIT OpenCourseware and Coursera programming courses. Early in my third year, I finished the degree in Romance Languages and began focusing on the analytical side of Lingusitics. I began using my knowledge of Python for various studies and enrolled in various classes in the Computer Science department, where I began learning Java. My last two years were a blend of Linguistics and Computer Science, learning OOP from the CS side and Machine Learning and data analytics from the Linguistics side. 

After the university, I moved to Barcelona with my girlfriend, and here we are.

#### The Website

The website is a collection of writings to record projects I'm working on, books or articles that I read, and almost anything else that I want to share with people interested in similar things as me. But more than anything else, it's so that my poor girlfriend doesn't have to listen to me ramble on about crazy things. 

The website itself is running on GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll as a static site generator, which allows me to easily implement the "posts" blog-like functionality. I am using the base theme and modifying the HTML and CSS to style the static content to whatever I like. On top of that, I am constantly updating the site with more and more Javascript to add dynamic feature on top of Jekyll. It's really a great way to have a quick setup, yet unlimited control over the design and structure of a website, in case you are interested.
