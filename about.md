I am a Software Developer living in Barcelona and working in [Puck Solutions](https://www.facebook.com/puck.solutions/?fref=ts), a nice, young company with a good company culture and great workmates. Our team creates an application on top of Salesforce's [Force.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce.com#Force.com) platform that allows private aviation companies to manage everything from ground operations, to sales and crew management. For front-end development, we use [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com), while for back-end we use [Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm), Salesforce's java-like programming language. 

My posts will be more about what I am doing on my own projects outside of work, whether they are on Python web apps, Natural Language Procesing or trying to build things with my [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). I am also hoping to write about books I read, places I travel to, craft beer, etc. for anybody interested in those things as well.

#### **My Past**

I graduated in 2015 from the University of North Carolina with a degree in Linguistics. In one of my posts, I will explain the connection between Linguistics and programming, and how I transitioned into a developer. But to put in quickly, Linguistics provided me with a good basis of analytical problem solving and introduction to programming. I then took it upon myself to learn Computer Science by taking MIT OpenCourseware and Coursera programming courses. With this background, I enrolled in courses in the Computer Science department, where I began learning Java, algorithm analysis, and mathematics for programming. My last two years at the universtity were Linguistics and Computer Science, learning OOP from the CS side and Machine Learning and data analytics from the Linguistics side. 

After the university, I moved to Barcelona with my girlfriend, and here we are.

#### **Website**

The website is a collection of writings to record projects I'm working on, books or articles that I read, and almost anything else that I want to share with people interested in similar things as me. But more than anything else, it's so that my poor girlfriend doesn't have to listen to me ramble on about crazy things. 

The website itself is running on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator, which allows me to easily implement the "posts" blog-like functionality. I am using the base theme and modifying the HTML and CSS to style the static content to whatever I like. On top of that, I am constantly updating the site with more and more Javascript to add dynamic feature on top of Jekyll. It's really a great way to have a quick setup, yet unlimited control over the design and structure of a website, in case you are interested.
