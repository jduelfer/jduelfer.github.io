I'm starting my blog to write about things that I would like to say; and by that, I mean things that my girlfriend or my poor mother can't stand listening to anymore. Also, with algorithms that now can predict your personality based on your posts and activities based on any contact with the internet, I feel that I should generate more content than horribly embarassing Facebook posts from when I was 15 years old (please don't go that far back if I'm being considered for a job). I'm using I alot, but this is the about me page, so there's really no way around it.

If you want to get to know me, read this post:

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
