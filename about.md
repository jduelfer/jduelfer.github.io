I am a Software Developer living in Barcelona and working in [Blackbird](http://www.blackbirdcrew.com/), a Startup focused on Salesforce Development and Consulting. My posts will be more about what I am doing on my own projects outside of work, whether they are on Python web apps, Natural Language Procesing or trying to build things with my [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

#### **My Past**

I graduated in 2015 from the University of North Carolina with a degree in Linguistics. In one of my posts, I will explain the connection between Linguistics and programming, and how I transitioned into a developer. But to put it quickly, Linguistics provided me with a good basis of analytical problem solving and introduction to programming. I then took it upon myself to learn Computer Science by taking MIT OpenCourseware and Coursera programming courses. With this background, I enrolled in courses in the Computer Science department, where I began learning Java, algorithm analysis and discrete mathematics. My last two years at the universtity were Linguistics and Computer Science, learning OOP from the CS side and a bit of Machine Learning and data analytics from the Linguistics side. 

After the university, I moved to Barcelona with my girlfriend, and here we are.

#### **Website**

The website is a collection of writings to record projects I'm working on, books or articles that I read, and almost anything else that I want to share with people interested in similar things as me. But more than anything else, it's so that my poor girlfriend doesn't have to listen to me ramble on about crazy things. 

The website itself is running on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator, which allows me to easily implement the "posts" blog-like functionality. I am using the base theme and modifying the HTML and CSS to style the static content to whatever I like. It's really a great way to have a quick setup, yet unlimited control over the design and structure of a website, in case you are interested.
