This post is about mounting an ultrasonic sensor on a servor motor and using it to get a 180 degree view of the robot car's surroundings. This will add to the obstacle avoidance algorithm by being able to look left and right when coming to an obstacle in order to decide which direction to turn.

### Material
________________

I am following a small tutorial in my Arduino Starter Kit. I also am lucky enough to have a friend with a 3D printer who printed my servo mount. It works very nicely, but if you could also hack something up with cardboard or plastic.

1. [Servo Motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomotor)
2. 2 Sided Tape: or something to attach the servo to the car
3. Mount for the Ultrasonic Sensor: [3D printed model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1104187) or your own stuff
